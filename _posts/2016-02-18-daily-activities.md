**Day 1 - Count Your Blessings - **Magic Practice Number 1****

1. First thing in the morning, make a list of ten blessings in your life you are grateful for.
2. Write why you're grateful for each blessing.
3. Go back and read your list, either in your mind or out loud. When you get to the end of each one, say the magic words, thank you, thank you, thank you, and feel the gratitude for that blessing as much as you possibly can.
4. Repeat the first three steps of this magical practice every morning for the next 27 days.
5. Read tomorrow's magical practice today.
